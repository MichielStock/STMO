<div class="markdown"><h1>Project: Hungarian algorithm</h1>
<p><strong>STMO</strong></p>
<p>2021-2022</p>
<p>project by Triana Forment</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Optimal transportation leads with two probability distributions and there is a cost function for moving elements from one distribution to the other distribution. And you have to find a transportation scheme to map one distribution into the other one. The original version of this problem of optimal transport dates back to Gaspard Monge in 1781. The Monge&#39;s problem has a discrete n number iron mines and n factories and, the cost is the distance between the mine and the factory. The solution is to find which mine suplies which factory, finding the minimum average distance transported.</p>
<p>The Hungarian algorithm solves an assignment problem which can be considered as a special type of transportation problem in which the number of sources and sinks are equal. The capacity of each source as well as the requirement of each sink is taken as 1. In this project, the Hungarian algorithm is implemented using an adjacency matrix. This algorithm can be used to find the map that minimizes the transport cost, given two distributions and a cost function. For two discrete probability vectors, <span class="tex">$\mathbf&#123;a&#125; ∈ Σ_n$</span> and <span class="tex">$\mathbf&#123;b&#125; ∈ Σ_m$</span>, we have a <span class="tex">$n \times m$</span> cost matrix <span class="tex">$C$</span>. It can be represented as a adjacency matrix, with elements in <span class="tex">$a$</span> as rows and elements in <span class="tex">$b$</span> as columns, and their weights as entries in the matrix. </p>
<p>An example of an assignment problem, can be, given <span class="tex">$n$</span> agents and the money they ask for performing each task, finding which agent performs which task in order to minimize the cost of performing all <span class="tex">$m$</span> tasks. When there are the same number of agents than tasks, the the problem is called balanced assignment, otherwise is called unbalanced assignment. And if the total cost is the sum for each agent performing its task, the problem is called linear assignment, because the cost function to be optimized as well as all the constraints contain only linear terms. This implementation can be used to solve linear balanced assignment problems.</p>

<div class="markdown"><h1>Implementation</h1>
</div>


<div class="markdown"><h2>Outline of the approach</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Subtract the smallest entry in each row from all the entries in the row, thus making the smallest entry in the row now equal to <code>0</code>. The same for each column.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mark the rows and columns which have 0 entries, such that the fewest lines possible are drawn.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If there are <span class="tex">$m$</span> marked rows and columns, an optimal assignment of zeros is possible and the algorithm is finished. The cost value and the optimal agent-task combination can be calculated. If the number of lines is less than <span class="tex">$m$</span>, then the optimal number of zeroes is not yet reached and the next step needs to be performed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Find the smallest entry not marked by any marked row and by any column. Subtract this entry from each row which is not marked, and then add it to each column which is marked. Then, go back to step 2.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>


<div class="markdown"><p><strong><code>Hungarian_algorithm</code></strong> is the funtion that uses as an input the cost matrix and gives as an output the cost value and the matrix solution. This function performs steps 1 to 4, by calling the previous functions. Once the marked rows and columns sum the number of tasks to perform, it calculates the cost value by adding each cost value of the different agent-task selected. The matrix solution has all zeros, except for each agent-task pair selected, where it has its original value.</p>
