        "In this chapter, we will introduce minimization problems on graphs. We will study an elementary problem in computer science: finding the *minimum spanning tree* (MST). The minimum spanning tree has plenty of real-world applications, such as designing computer-, telecommunication- or other supply networks, computer graphics, and bioinformatics. Interestingly, there are efficient algorithms that can find the minimum spanning tree for even huge problems! Along our way, we will also be getting acquainted with some new types of data structures other than simple matrices.\n\n\n# Graphs in Julia\n\nGraphs are principal tools in computer science. Most programming languages provide interfaces for graphs; Julia is no exception. A simple package for working with is [`LightGraphs.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/LightGraphs.jl). In this course, we will limit ourselves to using the basic data structures provided by these languages, arrays, sets, and dictionaries. The type system allows us to formally encode how we will represent graph structures.\n\n```\nEdgeList{T} = Array{Tuple{T,T},1}\nWeightedEdgeList{R,T} = Array{Tuple{R,T,T},1}\nVertices{T} = Array{T,1}\nAdjList{R,T} = Dict{T,Array{Tuple{R,T},1}}\n```\n\nDon't worry if you don't fully understand the above. It makes use of the type system and it allows us to use dispatch to select the best function.\n\nConsider the following example graph:\n\n![A small example to show how to implement graphs in Julia.](Figures/graph.png)\n\nThis graph can be represented using an *adjacency list*. We do this using a `Dict`. Every vertex is a key with the adjacent vertices given as a `set` containing tuples `(weight, neighbor)`. The weight is first because this makes it easy to compare the weights of two edges. Note that for every ingoing edge, there is also an outgoing edge, this is an undirected graph."

        "# Some useful data structures\n\n## Disjoint-set data structure\n\nImplementing an algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree is reasonably straightforward. The only bottleneck is that the algorithm requires the disjoint-set data structure to keep track of a set partitioned in several disjoined subsets.\n\nFor example, consider the following initial set of eight elements.\n\n![](Figures/disjointset1.png)\n\nWe decide to group elements A, B, and C together in a subset and F and G in another subset.\n\n![](Figures/disjointset2.png)\n\nThe disjoint-set data structure supports the following operations:\n\n- **Find**: check which subset an element is in. Is typically used to check whether two objects are in the same subset;\n- **Union** merges two subsets into a single subset.\n\nA Julia implementation of a disjoint-set is available in the `DataStructures` library. The function `DisjointSets` turns a list in a union set forest. The function `union!` will merge the sets of two elements while `in_same_set` can be used to check whether two items are in the same set. A simple example will make everything clear!"
